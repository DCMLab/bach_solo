Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 41, '0', '#viio7') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1012_01_Prelude
	The label '#viio7' in m. 41, onset 0 (MC 41, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of D.vi, it expresses the scale degrees
	('#7', '2', '4', '6') [('A#', 'C#', 'E', 'G')].
	The corresponding score segment has 3 within-label and 9 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.75 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 75, '3/4', 'ii6(2)') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1012_01_Prelude
	The label 'ii6(2)' in m. 75, onset 3/4 (MC 75, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).

	('4', '6', '3') [('G', 'B', 'F#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
