============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 7, '1/2', 'III') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1011_05_GavotteI
	The label 'III' in m. 6, onset 1/2 (MC 7, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of c.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('3', '5', '7') [('Eb', 'G', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.75 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
