============================================================

FIRST_BAR_MISSING_TEMPO_MARK_WARNING (29,) ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1011_06_GavotteII --
	No metronome mark found in the very first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 7, '3/4', '#viio6/v') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1011_06_GavotteII --
	The label '#viio6/v' in m. 6, onset 3/4 (MC 7, onset 3/4)
	                seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of c.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('#6', '1', '#4') [('A', 'C', 'F#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 8, '0', 'v') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1011_06_GavotteII --

	In the context of c.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('5', '7', '2') [('G', 'Bb', 'D')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
