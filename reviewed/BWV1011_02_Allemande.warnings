DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 16, '1/2', 'i6') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1011_02_Allemande
	The label 'i6' in m. 15, onset 1/2 (MC 16, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of c.v, it expresses the scale degrees
	('3', '5', '1') [('Bb', 'D', 'G')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
