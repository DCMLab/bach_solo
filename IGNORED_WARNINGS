DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 11, '1/8', 'i6') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1001_01_Adagio
	The label i6 makes sense in this context and the 16th note D could be treated as an accented passing note.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 13, '27/32', 'i.i6{') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1002_01_Allemanda
	The label i.i6{ in m12 could be a possibility if the main notes considered are D and F#; Bach does make this ambiguous.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 25, '5/8', 'V') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1002_01_Allemanda
	The label V at the end of m23 should be fine considering that chord is implied even without the A# present

INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 17) ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1004_01_Allemande
	The incomplete MC 17 (timesig 1, act_dur 7/8) is completed by 2 incorrect durations (expected: 1/8):
        {1: Fraction(1, 16), 18: Fraction(1, 16)}

INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 34) ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1004_01_Allemande
	The incomplete MC 34 (timesig 1, act_dur 7/8) is completed by 1 incorrect duration (expected: 1/8):
        {18: Fraction(1, 16)}

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 14, '1/4', 'I') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1007_03_Courante
	The label I in m13 can be okay; it's actually very ambiguous here, because it's only 1 voice implying notes of both I and V.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 30, '0', 'V6') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1009_07_Gique
	The label V6 in m.29 is plausible; another possibility is viio but the validator still complains because of the G pedal.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 16, '1/2', 'i6') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1011_02_Allemande
	The label i6 in m.15 could be plausible when ignoring all the other chroma as passing notes in the second half of the beat.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 18, '1/4', 'iio6') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1011_02_Allemande
	The label iio6 in m.17 could be plausible when taking the notes C and Ab and the b-natural as passing note.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 7, '1/2', 'III') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1011_05_GavotteI
	The label "III" in m6 could be plausible when understanding E-flat as the base chord and all else as passing.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 16, '0', 'V6') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1011_05_GavotteI
	The label "V6" in m15 could be plausible when substituting the A-flat as a G, please see special key signature considerations.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 27, '0', 'IV') ms3.Parse.bach_solo.BWV1011_05_GavotteI
	The label "IV" in m26 can be plausible when imagining the f minor chord as being the root chord and other notes are passing.
